<p style="font-size:20px">
In modern systems the classical modeling paradigm using static graphs may be restrictive or oversimplifying, 
as the interactions among the elementary system units usually change over time in a highly dynamic manner. 
For example, friendships are added and removed over time in a social network and 
links in a communication network may change dynamically, 
either according to a specific known pattern (satellites following a trajectory) 
or in an unpredictable manner (mobile ad hoc networks). 
The common characteristic in all these application areas is that the system structure, 
i.e. graph topology, is subject to <i>discrete changes over time</i>. 
In such dynamically changing graphs the notion of <i>vertex adjacency</i> needs to be 
revisited and various graph concepts, e.g. reachability and connectedness, now crucially 
depend on the exact <i>temporal ordering</i> of the edges' presence.<br><br>


A temporal graph is a graph that changes over time. Assuming discrete time and a fixed set V of vertices, 
a temporal graph can be viewed as a discrete sequence G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, ... of static graphs, each with vertex set V. 

Many notions and algorithms from the static case can be naturally transferred in a meaningful way 
to their temporal counterpart, while in other cases new approaches are needed to define the 
appropriate temporal notions. In particular, some problems become radically different and 
substantially more difficult when the time dimension is additionally taken into account.<br><br>


In this one-day workshop, recent advances in the area of temporal / dynamically changing graphs will be presented, 
as well as some of the key challenges will be highlighted. 
As this research area grows and broadens, our aim is to bring together people from theoretical and practical 
communities of temporal graphs in order to establish new and strengthen existing links between these communities.<br><br>

This workshop is the sequel of the three previous workshops at 
<a target="_blank" href="../ICALP-18-Satellite/Temporal-Graphs-ICALP-2018.html">ICALP 2018 (in Prague)</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="../ICALP-19-Satellite/Temporal-Graphs-ICALP-2019.html">ICALP 2019 (in Patras)</a>, and 
<a target="_blank" href="../ICALP-20-Satellite/Temporal-Graphs-ICALP-2020.html">ICALP 2020 (online)</a>.<br><br>


The workshop will run <strong style="color:red;">online on zoom.</strong> Presentations are given by invitation only. 
Everyone is welcome to register and attend. 
Despite what is written in the <a target="_blank" href="http://easyconferences.eu/icalp2021/">ICALP 2021 website</a> 
about the registration fees of the workshops, <strong><u style="color:red;background-color:yellow;">registration and 
partitipation to this workshop is free of charge</u> (for details see below).</strong> <br><br>

<p style="font-size:20px">
  Every presentation is given 25 minutes in total, which is expected to be 20 minutes of talk and 5 minutes of questions. 
  The presentations are grouped into four sessions (two in the morning and two in the afternoon). 
  Details of the invited speakers and the schedule can be found below.<br><br>

  We will have the following rules in place for the workshop to run smoothly:<br>

  - Please log in to the Zoom meeting using your REAL NAME and AFFILIATION, e.g. "Eleni Akrida, Durham University" or "Eleni Akrida, Durham".<br>
  - Please keep your microphone muted unless you would like to speak publicly, e.g. when are ask a question.<br>
  - Should you have any questions while a speaker is presenting, please try to not interrupt (unless you think it is necessary). 
  Instead, please prefer write "Q" (for "Question") or "C" (for "Comment") in the chat. 
  After the talk is over and it is time for questions, the chair of the session will advise those who have commented to ask their questions.
