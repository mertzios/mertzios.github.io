Assuming discrete time and a fixed set V of vertices, a temporal graph can be viewed as a discrete sequence G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, ... of static graphs, each with vertex set V. Many notions and algorithms from the static case can be naturally transferred in a meaningful way to their temporal counterpart, while in other cases new approaches are needed to define the appropriate temporal notions. In particular, some problems become radically different and substantially more difficult when the time dimension is additionally taken into account.<br><br>In this one-day workshop, recent advances in the area of temporal / dynamically changing graphs will be presented, as well as some of the key challenges will be highlighted.<br><br>Presentations are given by invitation only. Everyone is welcome to register and attend.</p></ul>  <!-- _____________ Practical information _____________ --><hr size="1" width="100%"><h3><strong>Practical information</strong></h3><ul><p style="font-size:20px">Every presentation is given 30 minutes in total, which is expected to be 25 minutes of talk and 5 minutes of questions. The presentations are grouped into three sessions (two in the morning and one in the afternoon). Details of the schedule can be found below.A participant can register only to the workshop (Monday 9 July), or to both the workshop and the conference (Monday 9 July to Friday 13 July). Early registration is until 31 May.<br><br>Full information about the registration to the workshop and/or the conference, as well as about accommodation, is given here: <br><a target="_blank" href="https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~icalp2018/registration">https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~icalp2018/registration</a></p></ul><!-- _____________ SCHEDULE _____________ --><hr size="1" width="100%"><p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Workshop Schedule (tentative) and List of Speakers</strong></p><p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Date of the Workshop:</strong> Monday 9 July 2018 </p><ul>  <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">9:00-9:30: <strong>Paola Flocchini</strong> (University of Ottawa, Canada) <br>  Decentralized computations by mobile agents in time-varying graphs </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>A large literature exists on distributed  computations by mobile agents operating in graphs.

Such a regularity forces some of the links to reappear infinitely often, although these links are   indistinguishable from the ones that appear finitely many times. The resulting uncertainty gives rise to a new notion of heredity in graph, which we will   illustrate through a number of basic properties and two classical problems (MIS and MDS).</p>  <p style="font-size:20px">This is a joint work with Swan Dubois, Franck Petit, and John Michael Robson.</i></p><br>        <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">10:00-10:30: <strong>Ralf Klasing</strong> (LaBRI and University of Bordeaux, France) <br>   Computing parameters of sequence-based dynamic graphs </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>We present a general framework for computing parameters of dynamic networks which are modeled as a sequence ( G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, ..., G<sub>&delta;</sub> ) of   static graphs such that G<sub>i</sub> = ( V, E<sub>i</sub> ) represents the network topology at time i and changes between consecutive static graphs are arbitrary.   The framework operates at a high level, manipulating the graphs in the sequence as atomic elements with two types of operations:   a "composition" operation and a "test" operation. The framework allows us to compute different parameters of dynamic graphs using a common high-level strategy   by using composition and test operations that are specific to the parameter. The resulting algorithms are optimal in the sense that they use only   O(&delta;) composition and test operations, where &delta; is the length of the sequence.   We illustrate our framework with three minimization problems, namely   "bounded realization of the footprint", "temporal diameter", and "round trip temporal diameter",   as well as with one maximization problem, namely "T-interval connectivity".    We prove that the problems are in the class NC by presenting polylogarithmic-time parallel versions of the algorithms.   Finally, we show that the algorithms can operate online with amortized complexity &Theta;(1) composition and test operations for each graph in the sequence.</p>  <p style="font-size:20px">This is joint work with Arnaud Casteigts, Yessin M.

Studying the structure and dynamics of   interactions is therefore crucial for many fundamental and applied questions   (like event detection in traffic, fraud fighting, recommender systems, network optimisation,   and the interplay between relations and interactions). Their structure is studied with graphs   and networks (sets of nodes and links); their dynamics is studied with signals and time series   (variations of a property over time); to study the dynamics of their structure, one uses graph   sequences. However, these approaches poorly capture the both structural and temporal nature of   interactions, that calls for a dedicated formalism. I will present a generalization of graphs,   that we call link streams and stream graphs, and that makes it possible to consistently handle   both aspects. We thus obtain a language for the study of interactions over time, similar to the one   provided by graphs for the study of relations.</i></p><br>      <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">12:00-12:30: <strong>Cl&eacute;mence Magnien</strong> (Sorbonne Universit&eacute; - LIP6, France) <br>   Algorithmic challenges in link streams: the case of clique computations </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>Link streams model interactions over time as sequences of triplets (t,u,v) meaning that an interaction between u and v occurred at time t.   Such interactions may represent financial transactions, network traffic, mobility, sales, contacts, messages, and many other objects of interest. A variety of graph concepts were   recently generalized to link streams, and are useful to describe such sequences of interactions. This includes clustering coefficient, k-cores, connected components, closeness, betweenness,   and cliques, that raise many algorithmic challenges. I will present in particular our works on clique computations in link streams, which already received much attention.   I will also illustrate their relevance in the contexts of network traffic and of contacts between individual analysis.</i></p><br>        <!-- COFFEE BREAK - START -->	  <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">12:30-14:00: <strong>Lunch break</strong></p><br>  <!-- COFFEE BREAK - END -->	        <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">14:00-14:30: <strong>Thomas Erlebach</strong> (University of Leicester, UK) <br>   Exploration of temporal graphs with bounded degree </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>For a given temporal graph that is connected in every step, the temporal exploration problem   asks for a shortest temporal walk that starts at a given start vertex and visits every vertex of the graph at least once.

We initiate a systematic study of the computational complexity of this problem, depending on the number k of time-labels that every   edge is allowed to have. To do so, we distinguish between the decision version StarExp(k) asking whether a complete exploration of the instance exists,   and the maximization version MaxStarExp(k) of the problem, asking for an exploration schedule of the greatest possible number of edges in the star.   We present a collection of results establishing the computational complexity of these two problems.</p>    <p style="font-size:20px">This is joint work with George B.

While there is an extensive literature on separators in “static” graphs, much less is known for the temporal setting. Building on previous work,   we study the problem of finding a small vertex set (the separator) in a temporal graph with two designated terminal vertices such that the removal of the set   breaks all temporal paths connecting one terminal to the other. Herein, we consider two models of temporal paths: paths that contain arbitrarily many hops per   time step (non-strict) and paths that contain at most one hop per time step (strict). Both versions of temporal separation are known to be NP-hard which   motivates a parameterized complexity analysis and studying the complexity of the problem on restricted classes of temporal graphs.</p>  <p style="font-size:20px">This talk will give an overview of recent results based on joint work with Philipp Zschoche, Till Fluschnik and Rolf Niedermeier.</i></p><br>              <!-- COFFEE BREAK - START -->	  <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">15:30-16:00: <strong>Coffee break</strong></p><br>  <!-- COFFEE BREAK - END -->	        <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px">16:00-17:00: <strong>Kitty Meeks</strong> (Part I; University of Glasgow, UK) and <strong>Jessica Enright</strong> (Part II; University of Edinburgh, UK) <br>   Reducing reachability in temporal graphs </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>The concept of reachability (i.e. which vertices in a graph can be reached by travelling along edges from a given starting vertex) is central to many applications,   including the dissemination of information or the spread of disease through a network.  Depending on the application, it might be desirable to increase or decrease   the number of vertices that are reachable from any one starting vertex.  In most applications, time plays a crucial role: each contact between individuals,   represented by an edge, will only occur at certain time(s).  The relative timing of edges is clearly crucial in determining the reachability of any vertex in the graph.</p>    <p style="font-size:20px">In this pair of talks, we will address the problems of reducing the maximum reachability of any vertex in a given temporal graph by two different means:</p>  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">  <li><p style="font-size:20px">we can remove a limited number of time-edges (times at which a single edge is active) from the graph, or</p></li>  <li><p style="font-size:20px">the number of timesteps at which each edge is active is fixed, but we can change the relative order at which different edges are active   (perhaps subject to constraints on which edges must be active simultaneously, or restrictions on the timesteps available for each edge).</p></li>  </ul>  <p style="font-size:20px">Mostly, we find that these problems are computationally intractable even when very strong restrictions are placed on the input, but we identify a small   number of special cases which admit polynomial-time algorithms, and raise a number of open questions.</i></p><br>                <!--<li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Dimitris Fotakis:</strong> TBA </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>  </i></p><br>-->    <!--  <li><p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Leszek Gasieniec:</strong> TBA </p>  <p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>   <i>  </i></p><br>  --></ul><hr size="1" width="100%"><h3><strong>Workshop organizers*</strong></h3><ul><p style="font-size:20px">  <li style="margin-bottom:-0.3cm"><p style="font-size:20px"><a target="_blank" href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/george.mertzios/">George B.
