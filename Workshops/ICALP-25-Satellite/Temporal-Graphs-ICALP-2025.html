<hr size="1" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Topic</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:20px">


In modern systems the classical modeling paradigm using static graphs may be restrictive or oversimplifying, 
as the interactions among the elementary system units usually change over time in a highly dynamic manner. 
For example, friendships are added and removed over time in a social network and 
links in a communication network may change dynamically, 
either according to a specific known pattern (satellites following a trajectory) 
or in an unpredictable manner (mobile ad hoc networks). 
The common characteristic in all these application areas is that the system structure, 
i.e. graph topology, is subject to <i>discrete changes over time</i>. 
In such dynamically changing graphs the notion of <i>vertex adjacency</i> needs to be 
revisited and various graph concepts, e.g. reachability and connectedness, now crucially 
depend on the exact <i>temporal ordering</i> of the edges' presence.<br><br>


A temporal graph is a graph that changes over time. Assuming discrete time and a fixed set \(V\) of vertices, 
a temporal graph can be viewed as a discrete sequence \(G_1, G_2, \ldots\) of static graphs, each with vertex set \(V\). 

Many notions and algorithms from the static case can be naturally transferred in a meaningful way 
to their temporal counterpart, while in other cases new approaches are needed to define the 
appropriate temporal notions. In particular, some problems become radically different and 
substantially more difficult when the time dimension is additionally taken into account.<br><br>


In this one-day workshop, recent advances in the area of temporal / dynamically changing graphs will be presented, 
as well as some of the key challenges will be highlighted. 
As this research area grows and broadens, our aim is to bring together people from theoretical and practical 
communities of temporal graphs in order to establish new and strengthen existing links between these communities.<br><br>

The topic of the workshop is of high interest and relevance to ICALP track A, as it mainly focuses on algorithms and computational complexity, 
but it can also straddle to parameterized complexity, structural graph theory, combinatorial optimization, distributed and mobile computing, 
as well as randomness in computation.<br><br>

	<i>
	Temporal graphs model networks with time-dependent connections. Small changes in their definition—such as whether paths must strictly increase in time, 
	whether adjacent edges may be active simultaneously, or whether multiple labels are allowed—give rise to different classes of temporal graphs 
	(temporal settings). In this talk, we analyze these classes through the lens of reachability equivalence: when do two temporal graph (classes) 
	induce the same reachability graphs? We discuss recent results and analyze the relations between aforementioned temporal settings.<br><br>

	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	Exploration is one of the best studied problems on temporal graphs, asking if an agent can visit every vertex in a temporal graph within a given 
	timeframe, while only being allowed to transition across a single active edge in each tilmestep. In this talk, we focus on on temporal graphs 
	with <u>frequent edges</u>, edges where we have a bound on the number of time steps between each activation. 
	We show that temporal graphs with highly frequent edges can be explored efficiently, requiring \(2F\) time steps where \(F\) 
	is a parameter based on the weight of the spanning tree on the underlying graph, with each edge weighted by it frequency. 
	We extend this to several applications, including public transport network graphs (graphs formed by merging several temporal walks) 
	and broadcast networks (temporal graphs modelling communication networks in the broadcast model).<br><br>

	<i>
	 The temporal exploration problem (TEXP) asks for a walk in a given temporal graph, where at most one edge is traversed in each time step, 
	 and all vertices are visited. In this talk we will consider the temporal exploration problem (TEXP) on a model of random temporal graphs 
	 which are connected in each time step. It is known that there are n-vertex temporal graphs which are connected in each time step but 
	 require \(\Omega(n^2)\) steps to explore, our aim is to understand what happens against a random adversary. 
	 In our model an adversary supplies a measure \(\mu\) supported on a set of (labelled) spanning trees on \(n\) vertices, 
	 and we obtain a (random) temporal graph by sampling a spanning tree from \(\mu\) at each time step independently. 
	 We show that, for any \(\mu\), w.h.p. there is a schedule which explores the corresponding temporal graph in time \(O(n^{3/2})\). 
	 Furthermore, we provide an example of \(\mu\) which requires \(\Omega(n^{3/2})\) steps to explore in expectation.

	Motivated by modeling time-dependent processes on networks like social interactions and infection spread, we consider a version of the

	of edges with increasing time stamps. We present results on the lengths of the shortest and longest increasing paths, as well as the size 
	of the largest temporal clique that exhibits a remarkable phase transition. We also introduce a novel random tree model motivated by random

	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	Temporal graphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity (temporal spanners). 
	However, in the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size \(O(n log n)\) are guaranteed. The original proof of this result combined 
	a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In this talk, we show that dismountability is actually all you need, 
	combining different versions of this core principle that have been developed by several groups of researchers in the recent years. 
	If time permits, I will then discuss some connections between dismountability and another core technique called pivotability, 
	and present a new class of labelings that admit spanners of size \(2n-3\). 
	This is joint work with Arnaud Casteigts and Timothée Corsini [SAND 2025].<br><br>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Temporal triadic closure: Finding dense structures in social networks that evolve</strong></p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	 A graph \(G\) is \(c\)-closed if every two vertices with at least \(c\) common neighbors are adjacent to each other. 
	 This definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend 
	 to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static---the connections change over a period of time. 
	 And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce 
	 a definition of temporal \(c\)-closed graphs, in which if two vertices \(u\) and \(v\) have at least \(c\) common neighbors during a short 
	 interval of time, then \(u\) and \(v\) are adjacent to each other around that time. 
	 Our preliminary empirical analysis indicates that real-world temporal networks are \(c\)-closed for rather small values of \(c\). 
	 We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal \(c\)-closed graphs. 
	 We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal \(c\)-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the 
	 corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, 
	 the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters 
	 for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms. This is joint work with Tom Davot, Jessica Enright and Kitty Meeks.

    <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>How to color temporal graphs to ensure proper transitions</strong></p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	Graph Coloring consists in assigning colors to vertices, ensuring that two adjacent vertices do not have the same color. 
	In dynamic graphs, this notion is not well defined, as we need to decide if different colors for adjacent vertices must happen 
	all the time or not, and how to go from a coloring at one time to the next one. We will define a coloring notion for Temporal Graphs where, 
	at each step, the coloring must be proper. It uses a notion of compatibility between two consecutive snapshots that implies that the 
	coloring stays proper while the transition happens. Given a graph, the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that such a coloring 
	exists is the <u>Temporal Chromatic Number</u> of this graph. With those notions, we provide some lower and upper bounds for the temporal 
	chromatic number in the general case. We then dive into some specific classes of graphs, such as trees, graphs with bounded degree, 
	or bounded degeneracy. Finally, we consider temporal graphs where grow pace is one, that is, a single edge can be added and a single 
	other one can be removed between two time steps. In that case, we consider bipartite and bounded-degree graphs. Even though the problem is 
	defined with full knowledge of the temporal graph, our results also work in the case where future snapshots are given online: 
	we need to choose the coloring of the next snapshot after having computed the current one, not knowing what will come later.

	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	Graphs offer a flexible way to represent complex relationships in many domains, including social networks, biology, and neuroscience. 
	In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular tools for learning from such structured data, showing strong performance 
	in tasks like node classification, link prediction, and graph-level analysis. However, many systems in the real world are not static, 
	they change over time. To take these dynamics into account, we need models that can reason not only about how things are connected, but also when.<br><br>
	
	In this talk, I will give a general introduction to GNNs and then focus on their temporal counterparts: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). 
	These models are designed to work with dynamic graphs, where both the structure and features can evolve. 
	I will describe some of the main types of TGNNs proposed in the literature and explain how they work.<br><br>
	
	To conclude, I will show a few examples of how TGNNs can be applied in practice, including in the analysis of traffic data and the 
	modeling of brain activity over time.<br><br>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Scalable temporal motif densest subnetwork discovery</strong></p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20px"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
	<i>
	Finding dense subnetworks, with density based on edges or more complex structures, such as subgraphs or $k$-cliques, 
	is a fundamental algorithmic problem with many applications. While the problem has been studied extensively in static networks, 
	much remains to be explored for temporal networks. 
	In this work we introduce the novel problem of identifying the temporal motif densest subnetwork, i.e., the densest subnetwork 
	with respect to temporal motifs, which are high-order patterns characterizing temporal networks. Identifying temporal motifs is 
	an extremely challenging task, and thus, efficient methods are required to compute the temporal motif densest subnetwork. 
	To address this challenge, we design two novel randomized greedy approximation algorithms with rigorous probabilistic guarantees 
	that provide high-quality solutions. We perform extensive experiments showing that our methods outperform baselines based on 
	state-of-the-art approaches for an analogous static problem. Furthermore, our algorithms scale on networks with up to billions 
	of temporal edges, while baselines cannot handle such large networks. We use our techniques to analyze a financial network and 
	show that our formulation reveals important network structures.<br><br>
